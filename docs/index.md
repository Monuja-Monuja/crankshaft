## What is Crankshaft?

`crankshaft` is a **headless task execution framework** written in Rust. It provides a robust and performant library for developers building applications (like workflow managers) that need to run computational tasks across diverse environments such as:

*   **Local Machines:** Via Docker containers.
*   **Cloud Platforms:** Using the GA4GH Task Execution Service (TES) API.
*   **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Clusters:** Through a configurable `Generic` backend, often utilizing SSH.

It focuses on the core mechanics of task submission, monitoring, resource management, and concurrency, allowing the consuming application to handle the higher-level workflow logic and user interface.

## Why Crankshaft?

*   **Performance:** Built with Rust and Tokio for efficient, concurrent task handling suitable for large-scale bioinformatics or similar workloads.
*   **Flexibility:** Abstract away backend differences. Write your task logic once and run it on Docker, TES, or HPC with only configuration changes.
*   **Integration:** Designed as a library (`lib.rs`) to be embedded within larger Rust applications, giving you full control over the user experience and workflow definition.
*   **Extensibility:** While providing core backends, the architecture allows for potential future expansion.
